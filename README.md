# Feed Aggregator

This is the sample program which aggregates feed contents to one rss feed.
This is the background story.
When I come up with idea that notifying new rss feed to slack, first I planned to use [ifttt](https://ifttt.com) and [feedly](https://feedly.com/) as a trigger of source of rss feed.
HOWEVER, feedly does not open feed of unreaded contents for free users, only for paid users.
If I am using premium functionalities they offer other than aggregated feed, I would pay, but it's not.
So, I started to create simple feed aggregator.

## TODO
 - [ ] test opml reader
